I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at [IMCL lab](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~labimcl/index.html) in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, advised by Prof. [Jiannong Cao](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/).
Prior that, I received my PhD degree from the [Chongqing University](https://www.cqu.edu.cn/), where I'm honored to be advised by Prof. [Kai Liu](https://eie.cqu.edu.cn/info/1204/1175.htm).

My research interests include edge intelligence, mobile computing and vehicular networks.
My past work mainly focused on the communication-computation collaboration for cooperative inference and perception in vehicular edge intelligence. 
Currently, I am working on LLM inference acceleration and 6G-enabled ISAC.

I am open to academic collaborations and welcome discussions concerning potential research partnerships.
